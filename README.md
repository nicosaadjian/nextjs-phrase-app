# Phrase Manager App

This project is built with Next.js and combines built-in components like `Link` with shadcn/ui components such as `Button` and `Skeleton`.

Additionally, I created custom components including `PhraseForm` and `ThemeToggle` to enhance functionality.

The app uses `localStorage` to persist phrases, so it doesn't have a traditional backend. However, `localStorage` emulates this persistence to demonstrate the app's utility.

You can also delete phrases from `localStorage` directly through the interface.
